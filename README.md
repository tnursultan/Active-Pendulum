# Active-Pendulum
Simulation of a DC motor powered pendulum that uses a Simulink-based P-controller. Can rotate to any angle input at 99% accuracy.

### To run the project:
1) Run TFandRL.m in MATLAB
2) Run system.slx in Simulink (will keep running until the SimulationX file is run and terminated)
3) Run systemfin.isx in SimulationX

- Terminating the project in SimulationX will terminate the project in Simulink.
